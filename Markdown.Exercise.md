# **Art Appreciation Notes**
## **Chapter 1**
### **Aesthetics**: 
Branch of philosophy that deals with feelings aroused by the sensory experiences of sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell.

#### ***Functions of Artists:***
1.	Create a place for some human purpose (Maya Lin’s *Vietnam War Memorial* which includes a reflecting wall that not only has etched in the names of the fallen soldiers of the war, but also lets the tourist observes themselves on that wall and creates a sense of empathy, awe, and melancholy) ![Untitled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bad7fec-3289-47a6-9cde-f18b29df6352)

2.	Create extraordinary versions of everyday objects (*Stemmed Vessel from Weifang, Shandong, China*, depicts a long-stemmed cup that would not ordinarily have been used for everyday purposes, but instead shows us what the artist can do. Another example would be runway shows featuring exaggerated versions of the season’s fashion line).   ![Untitled-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68914c73-2173-419a-bb64-7c4ee355c524)

4.	Record and commemorate (*Jahangir Receives a cup from Khusrau*, by Manohar, depicts the moment when father and son reconciled after their falling out and is used as a historical record since those people did exist, along with that exchange). ![Untitled-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3eaea78-d86d-47c6-94ca-3083a7469d21)

5.	Give tangible form to the unknown (*Shiva Nataraja, 10th century Bronze statue*, shows us a visual depiction of the goddess shiva, who no one has ever seen in real life) ![Untitled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6ce70ae-0dba-4fec-83cc-2e0a39adcd36)

6.	Give tangible form to feelings/ideas (Van Gogh’s  *The Starry Night*, a painting that makes you feel as though you’re moving with the emotions and motions of that melancholic piece) ![Untitled-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e00aa655-0fd2-40f7-ac37-cc330b566876)

7.	Refresh our vision and help us see the world in new ways (*Peeling Paint on an Iron Bench* by Ernst Haas, although it is a photograph, it embodies the beauty and the serenity of time passing by and the season involved; the paint is wearing out with the help of the elements of the seasons, giving way to the iron underneath. You can see the contrast between the red paint, the fall-colored leaves, the deep black of the iron bench, and while simple, it plays with your visual senses)![Untitled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21037e63-0c80-40a5-97ce-9d6bfae1ca24)

#### ***Creativity and traits shared by artists:***
-	Sensitivity: heightened awareness
-	Flexibility: adapt to new possibilities
-	Originality: creatively problem solve
-	Playfulness: humor & experimentation
-	Productivity: ability to generate ideas
-	Fluency: free flow of ideas
-	Analytical skill: exploring problems
-	Organizational skill: coherently ordering things

#### ***Looking and Responding to Art:***
1.	Since eyes are required to analyze visual art, not every piece will be viewed the same way by two different people, the reason for that has to do with the psychological aspect of the way each will analyze an object. Their individual perception can be influenced by their moods, backgrounds, or even prior experiences.
2.	Selective Perception: Filtering visual information to allow us to focus on the immediate tasks at hand. This is a process utilized when looking at art. The more we know about a piece, the more we go back to it repeatedly.  The excitement that comes with finding out new details of an art piece is what gives it new perceptions, so looking at and seeing all the details will always be more important.
3.	 Vanitas: (Latin for “vanity”) Refers to the fleeting nature of earthly life and happiness. Shows how different artists treat a common theme and allows us to explore visual associations.

### **What is art?** 
Art is anything that looks appealing to the human eye and that is attributed value to depending on how creative the piece is considered.
> Art is to console those who are broken by life.
>
> — Vincent Van Gogh.

1.**Art and Value:** the value of a piece of art has a lot to do with the artist that has submitted it, its history, the technique that was used, if it is at all mysterious, if it makes us think,  the life of its creator, and these days, it requires a certain amount of public relations in order for an artist to be seen. However, there are paintings and works of art that have stood the test of time by their sheer greatness and creativity. Paintings like the Mona Lisa for example, which is the most famous painting in the world recognizable by everyone and has no price.

2.**Art and Audience**: in the past, most artists were commissioned by wealthy people to paint them, create something decorative for their houses, and even make them jewelry. As such, early renaissance artists were not in the market to make a name for themselves through their art. Their role as artists was simply to abide by what their patrons were asking of them ( fortunately for us, those early wealthy patrons commissioned brilliant works of arts that we are still enjoying today).This changed a couple of hundred years later, when artists such as Monet, who worked diligently on his craft for years without getting rich, but soon became recognized as a prominent figure in the field. These days his paintings are still adored and contemplated by everybody. There are also pieces of art that maybe were not considered art by the artists who created them, but their execution makes it so regular people would consider it art, an example of that being James Hampton’s Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations’ Millenium General Assembly. It being a religious piece that was discovered after the artist was dead suggests that maybe the artist did not mean to share it.

3.	**Art and Beauty:** could be geometrical, symmetrical, and colorful.
- a.	Aesthetics: Branch of philosophy that studies art and the nature of beauty (the two are oftentimes linked).
- b.	Disinterested Contemplation: Looking at art with appreciation and pleasure while setting aside any personal and practical stake in what we’re looking at. Scanning a bowl of fruit to decide which apple to eat is an interested contemplation while observing a still life painting of the same bowl of fruit would be a disinterested one.
- c.	Outsiders/insiders: although art is subjective to everyone, there are those who have trained for years to achieve the level of expertise that they acquired through school, training, and practice. These artists are called insiders while artists who have not been classically trained, but who also exhibit great proficiency are called art outsiders.  The line gets blurred.
4.	**Art and Appearance:** photography made art that was used to tell us the stories of the day (representational art) almost obsolete, leading artists like Picasso to explore different avenues and create unique styles (abstracts):
- a.	Representational (naturalistic): life-like, clear subject matter and context. Extreme is Trompe l’oeil where the art piece could fool the viewer into thinking it’s real life.
- b.	Non-representational (abstract): not necessarily life-like, more whimsical and although would depict a story, it would not be told with clear cut lines. Its extreme is non-objective art, which relies on the former elements of art rather than creating a recognizable subject matter.
- c.	Stylized: refers to representational art that conforms to a preset style be it cultural. A mix between the top two.

5.	**Style**: reoccurring or constant characteristics in an artist’s work. An artist’s true signature.

6.	**Art and meaning**: What distinguishes art from other skilled making is that art always has a meaning. subject matter (what is being represented) + form (appearance, style, elements of art and principle of design) = content (the meaning of the work of art)
- a.	Form: Physical appearance of the work, colors, shapes, organization.
- b.	Content: what the work is about.

7.	**Iconography:** Study of symbols within a work of art (Arnolfini Double Portrait, Jan Van Eyck is a clear example of this, so many items that lead the work to ambiguous meanings.)

8.	**Context:** the personal, social, cultural and historical setting in which the art was created, received, and interpreted. Cubism happened because of the invention of photography, such is the context behind the emergence of abstract works.
